          Hi! I'm <strong>Paulin Junior Nzodoum</strong> — a Full Stack
          Developer with a strong interest in DevOps and a passion for the
          cloud.
          <br />
          I love building applications as well as the infrastructure behind
          them. From writing clean code to automating deployments and scaling
          systems with Docker, Kubernetes, and platforms like AWS and GCP, I aim
          to create smart, resilient solutions.
          <br />
          Always curious and eager to learn, I enjoy turning ideas into
          production-ready systems.
